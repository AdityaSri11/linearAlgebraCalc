# Linear Algebra Calculator

# About the Project
Throughout my sophmore year of college, myself and my engineering friends had a tough time with the Linear Algebra class, including various questions with matrix reduction, and solution finding. This python package aims to assist in some of the simple functions that needed to be computed in order to succeed in the linear algebra class. The package incldues functions ranging from simple four function operations to finding the solution of equations or determinent or transpose of a matrix etc... 

The package can be found with more information, and the source code on the website: https://pypi.org/project/linearAlgebraCalc/
